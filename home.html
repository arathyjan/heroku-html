    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>
      You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<BR/>
      You make me happy when skies are gray<BR/>
      You'll never know dear how much I love you<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away<BR/>
      
      The other night dear, as I lay sleeping<BR/>
      I dreamed I held you in my arms<BR/>
      But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken<BR/>
      So I hung my head and I cried.<BR/>
      
      You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<BR/>
      You make me happy when skies are gray<BR/>
      You'll never know dear, how much I love you<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away<BR/>
      
      I'll always love you and make you happy,<BR/>
      If you will only say the same.<BR/>
      But if you leave me and love another,<BR/>
      You'll regret it all some day:<BR/>
      
      You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<BR/>
      You make me happy when skies are gray<BR/>
      You'll never know dear, how much I love you<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away<BR/>
      
      You told me once, dear, you really loved me<BR/>
      And no one else could come between.<BR/>
      But now you've left me and love another;<BR/>
      You have shattered all of my dreams:<BR/>
      
      You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<BR/>
      You make me happy when skies are gray<BR/>
      You'll never know dear, how much I love you<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away<BR/>
      
      In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me<BR/>
      When I awake my poor heart pains.<BR/>
      So when you come back and make me happy<BR/>
      I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.<BR/>
      
      You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<BR/>
      You make me happy when skies are gray<BR/>
      You'll never know dear, how much I love you<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away<BR/>
      Please don't take my sunshine away(x2)
